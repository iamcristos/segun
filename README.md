# segun for this app the number to be inputed must be 3 digits for the result to be displayed eg 123.. we should have 1**3+2**3+3**3= 36
now if the number inputed is not 3 digit the check button once clicked should be disabled and once the user still click it when disabled an error message should be displayed
